# Styled Components
## 1. Installation
npm install styled-components

## 2. GlobalStyle:
GlobalStyle is a styled component that contains CSS rules you want to apply globally. When you include <GlobalStyle /> within your React application, it injects these styles into the <head> of your HTML document, ensuring they apply to all elements in your app.

## 3. ThemeProvider:
 ThemeProvider component allows you to define a theme and make it available to all styled components within your application. This is particularly useful for maintaining consistent styles and theming across your components.

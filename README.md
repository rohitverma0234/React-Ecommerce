# Props
## 1. Definition
Props stands for properties and refers to the mechanism for passing data from one component to another within an application.

## 2. Here's how it works:
1. <b>Parent Component Passing Data:</b> A parent component can pass data to a child component by using attributes similar to HTML attributes.

2. <b>Receiving Props</b>: The child component receives the data passed by the parent as props. Props are received as an object within the child component.

3. <b>Immutable Data</b>: Props are immutable, meaning that a child component cannot directly modify the props it receives from its parent. They are read-only.

4. <b>Functional and Class Components</b>: Props can be used with both functional and class components in React.
